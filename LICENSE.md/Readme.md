Had created a prototype structured from my idea.
The pandemic made it difficult for diabetic and other diseased patients to visit hospitals for regular checkups as they are more vulnerable to COVID-19.
Therefore, a solution :)


IMMUNIFY - A health check-up at home service provider that would bring in medical tests, consultations and medicines to your home.


So, this app IMMUNIFY will be actually having three sections - 

1. Online consultation with well qualified docs in their respective fields. They will be available 24x7 for your consultation requirements. 
They may prescribe medicines or lab tests for diagnosing your ailment. They will have a thorough follow up until you are satisfied with your consulation.

2. Services such as sample collection, bringing in lab reports and even buying prescribed medication will be done by our efficient team.

3. Last but not the least, we will be having a self diagnosing section where you can access things like BMI calculator, heart rate calculator, calorie intake calculator etc.
After self diagnosing, you will receive a personalized plan (like a diet plan) for your well being.
